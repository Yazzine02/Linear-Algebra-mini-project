# Linear Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to two linear programming exercises implemented in Python. The exercises involve formulating linear programming problems and solving them to optimize certain objectives.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Linear Programming with Two Decision Variables

This exercise involves a company that produces two types of paints, P1 and P2, using three raw materials, M1, M2, and M3. The goal is to maximize the company's profit while adhering to certain constraints on the proportions of raw materials used.

#### Problem Statement
- Formulate a linear programming problem to maximize the company's profit.
- Specify the decision variables and constraints.

#### Solution
- Implement the linear programming problem in Python.
- Utilize the `pulp` library for solving the optimization problem.
- Provide a detailed explanation of the Python implementation.

### Exercise 2: Linear Programming with Three Decision Variables

This exercise involves an industry that produces beverages, including fruit juices, non-carbonated drinks, and dairy-based drinks. The objective is to maximize the industry's revenue while considering various constraints on production capacity and budget.

#### Problem Statement
- Formulate a linear programming problem to maximize the industry's profit.
- Define decision variables and constraints.

#### Solution
- Implement the linear programming problem using Python.
- Apply the simplex method for optimization.
- Describe the simplex method and its application in solving the problem.
